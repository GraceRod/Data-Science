# Serial-Killer-Data-Analysis

In this work, we analyse serial killer data and focus on the age at which serial killers committed their first murder. The data being used for this analysis is based on a sample of serial killers from the Radford/FGCU Serial Killer Database. The sample data set has nine features: KillerID, AgeFirstKill, AgeLastKill, YearBorn, Motive, Sex, Race, Sentence and InsanityPlea. 

For our analysis, the features we’re interested in are AgeFirstKill, AgeLastKill, and Motive. AgeFirstKill tells us the age (in years) at which each killer committed their first murder. We only consider the data where the killers’ first kill was from 1900. AgeLastKill contains the age (in years) of the killer when they committed their last murder. Motive gives us the reason each killer committed the murders if known. There are three motives in the sample used in this analysis – Angel of Death, Robbery or Financial Gain, and Unknown, where the motive is not known. 

Previous research suggests that the population mean for serial killers who were active before the 1900s is 27. The main aim of this project is to determine whether the average age at first murder differs between killers with different motives. We will also explore other questions like: do killers with different motives start killing at a different age compared to the general population?
